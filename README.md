##  Description  
The **Stock Portfolio Manager** is a simple and educational project designed to manage and track stock investments through a Java backend and an HTML-based frontend interface.  
It provides essential **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, allowing users to manage stock data, view portfolio performance, and simulate investment growth in a user-friendly way.  

This project demonstrates core concepts in **web development, API design, and Java programming**, making it perfect for learning how backend and frontend interact.

---

##  Features  
– Add, update, and delete stock records  
– View portfolio performance and total value  
– Organized CRUD-based backend structure  
– Lightweight and easily extendable for learning or demos  
– Clean HTML frontend for interaction  

---

##  Technology Stack  
| Layer | Technology |
|--------|-------------|
| **Backend** | Java (Maven, Spark framework) |
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS |
| **Architecture** | CRUD API model |
| **Build Tool** | Apache Maven |

##  Calculation Logic  
- Each **Stock** includes data like symbol, shares, and price.  
- The **Value** of each stock is computed as:  
``` value = shares × price ```

- The **Total Portfolio Value** = sum of all stock values.  
- CRUD API endpoints handle operations for adding, updating, reading, and deleting stock entries.  

---

## Requirements

- **Java 17 or newer**  
- **Maven** (included wrapper: `mvnw`)  
- Any browser for frontend access

---
